## Getting started - to recreate this project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. #### `npx create-react-app browser-router-demo`

2. #### `npm install react-router-dom`

Notice version of react-router-dom installed in the package.json file.
This project uses version 6.2.1, which is relatively new & has replaced "Switch" statements with "Routes"
[See this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63124161/attempted-import-error-switch-is-not-exported-from-react-router-dom/69849271#69849271)

If you want/need to use "Switch", then will need the older version of react-router-dom, which you can install with:

#### `npm install react-router-dom@5`

3. Then set up the App.js, Router.js, components as needed

4) Run `npm start`
